The GlobalBlocklist extension extends the [UrlTracker package](https://github.com/Infocaster/UrlTracker) and gives a quick and easy way to block a lot of unwanted request from polluting your database. This is mostly used to block certain urls that crawlers search for.

The entire list can be found [here](https://github.com/Infocaster/UrlTracker.GlobalBlocklist). Feel free to contribute!
